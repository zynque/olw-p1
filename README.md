Open Language Web Prototype 1

## What?
This is the first prototype of what is now called Open Language Web.
At the time of this prototype it was called Open Language Programming, and the project was called FSOLP for "F Sharp Open Language Programming".
For the latest prototype see: https://github.com/zynque/olw-p4
This project is extremely rough/experimental, but is kept around for historical purposes. You can see the basic concepts start to take form (an immutable tree data structure for program source code, rendered/interpreted under various contexts to generate visual representations of the programs, executable versions of the programs, etc.)

## Quick Start:
* Download Visual Studio Community Edition
* Set up with F# support upon installation
* Open FSOLP.sln with Visual Studio
* Build Solution & Run
